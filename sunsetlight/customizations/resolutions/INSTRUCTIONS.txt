In order to activate the resolution fixes remove the underscore from the folder name that matches your aspect ratio!
EX: if you use a 4:3 aspect ration you will rename 4x3_ to 4x3.

VERY IMPORTANT!!! ONLY ONE FOLDER CAN STAY WITHOUT UNDERSCORE!!!
as you remove the underscore from one folder make sure to add it to any folder that was previously active!
