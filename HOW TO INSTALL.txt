//// RESOLUTION FIXES: //////
/////////////////////////////

If you are using a 4:3 or 16:10 aspect ratio you will also require to apply the fixes for said ratios, in order to do so:

1. Open the customizations > resolutions folder, inside you will find 3 folders for 4x3, 16x10 and 16x9 resolutions
2. Uncomment the folder that matches your aspect ratio by removing the underscore from the folder name.
3. ONLY 1 FOLDER SHOULD STAY UNCOMMENTED MAKE SURE YOU COMMENT ANY FOLDER NOT IN USE!!

/////////////////////////////
/// CUSTOMIZATIONS USAGE ////
/////////////////////////////

All the customizations can be found inside the Customizations folder and from there all you need to do is:

1. Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated file
2. Inside the file uncomment (by removing the // before the #base) the line of the customization you want to apply
