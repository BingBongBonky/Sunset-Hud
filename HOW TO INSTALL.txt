//// HUD INSTALLATION: //////
/////////////////////////////

1. Unzip the hud and open the sunsethud-master folder

2. Choose between the SunsetLight or SunsetDark theme, check out the screenshot albums to decide!

Dark:	https://imgur.com/a/Z8KJa9B

3. Based on what you decided, copy and paste the sunsetlight OR sunsetdark folder to your custom tf folder EG: (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\sunsetlight)

If you are using a 4:3 or 16:10 aspect ration replace all the files you find inside the "4x3 - 16x10 Overrides" folder over the normal hud files!

/////////////////////////////
/// CUSTOMIZATIONS USAGE ////
/////////////////////////////

All the customizations can be found inside the Customizations folder and from there all you need to do is:

1. Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated file
2. Inside the file uncomment (by removing the // before the #base) the line of the customization you want to apply



Thank you for using Sunset Hud <3
