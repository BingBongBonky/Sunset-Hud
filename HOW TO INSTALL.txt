1. Copy the sunset hud folder (NOT Sunset-Hud-Master)
2. Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\sunset hud)
3. Go to Resource/Scheme/Fonts select all the font and install them (rightclick while selected and install)

If you are using a 4:3 or 16:10 aspect ration replace the all the files you find inside the "4x3 - 16x10 Overrides" folder over the normal hud files!
