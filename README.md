<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud and open the sunsethud-master folder

**2)** Choose between [Light](https://imgur.com/a/4BZs0ih) or [Dark](https://imgur.com/a/Z8KJa9B) theme

**3)** Based on what you decided, copy and paste the sunsetlight OR sunsetdark folder to your custom tf folder EG: (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\sunsetlight)

**NOTES:**

If you are using a **4:3 or 16:10** aspect ration replace the all the files you find inside the "4x3 & 16x10 Overrides" folder over the normal hud files.

I suggest using **"tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1"** since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.


<a>CUSTOMIZATION</a>
====

My hud supports different customizations, it is possible to easily replace stuff like scoreboard, health styles, colors and crosshairs!

All the customizations can be found inside the Customizations folder and from there all you need to do is:

**1)** Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated file

**2)** Inside the file uncomment (by removing the // before the #base) the line of the customization you want to apply
